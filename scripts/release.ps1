.SYNOPSIS
    Cut a release of Thief Head Tracking.
.DESCRIPTION
    Validates preconditions, writes the new version into CMakeLists.txt and the
    two files derived from it, generates CHANGELOG.md from the commits since the
    last tag, builds, commits, tags and pushes. The pushed tag triggers
    .github/workflows/release.yml.

    Runs unattended end to end. Typing the command is the authorization: there
    is no confirmation prompt and no -Yes switch. Every safety property is a
    deterministic precondition that exits non-zero with a one-line diagnostic -
    on main, clean tree, tag absent, semver valid, notices in sync.

    Never destructive: no force push, no amend, no tag overwrite.
.NOTES
    Run via: pixi run release <major|minor|patch|nightly|X.Y.Z>
