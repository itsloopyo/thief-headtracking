.SYNOPSIS
    Dev deploy: drop the built .asi and the vendored ASI loader into the local
    Thief install.
.DESCRIPTION
    Thin wrapper over cameraunlock-core's Invoke-DevDeployASILoader, which owns
    game resolution (env var -> registry -> Steam -> games.json), the
    "game is running" check, and the loader-present check. A caller-supplied
    path wins outright, matching install.cmd's "trust the argument" semantics.

    Non-interactive: every failure exits non-zero with a one-line diagnostic.
.NOTES
    Run via: pixi run install
