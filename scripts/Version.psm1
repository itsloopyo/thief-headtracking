#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    The mod version: where it is read from, where it is written to, and what
    has to agree with it.
.DESCRIPTION
    CMakeLists.txt's project(... VERSION ...) is canonical. Two other files
    carry the same number and are derived from it:

      CMakeLists.txt      project(VERSION)  - what the release tag is checked against
      scripts/install.cmd MOD_VERSION       - what the installer writes to the state file
      pixi.toml           workspace.version - what the workspace reports

    .github/workflows/release.yml passes `version-source: cmake` and
    `version-path: CMakeLists.txt` to cameraunlock-core's release-mod.yml, which
    reads the tag's version out of the same declaration. Moving canonical
    anywhere else silently splits the local release path from the CI one.

    Before this module each of release.ps1, package-release.ps1 and
    release-nightly.ps1 carried its own copy of the regexes, so the set of files
    that carry the version was written down three times and read back
    differently in each. It is written down once, here.

Set-StrictMode -Version Latest

# Matches cameraunlock-core's Get-ProjectVersion -Source cmake, which is what CI
# reads. Duplicated rather than delegated so this module stands alone: two of
# its three callers import it before (or without) ReleaseWorkflow.psm1.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Throws unless every derived copy of the version matches CMakeLists.txt.
.DESCRIPTION
    This is what makes "derived from CMakeLists.txt" true rather than intended.
    Set-ModVersion writes all three in one pass, so a mismatch means one of them
    was hand-edited; shipping it would tag a release against one number and
    install a different one.
