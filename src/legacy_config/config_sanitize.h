// time constant), and the core clamps that speed to [0.1, 50] itself, so a
// value outside the range no longer drives the per-frame factor negative. It
// just saturates at one end while the INI goes on advertising a setting the mod
// is not honouring, so the clamp stays: it keeps the stored value and the
// behaviour in agreement, and gives the caller something to log.
//
// This is validation, never a floor. Any value inside [0,1] reaches the
// processor untouched, 0.0 included. `fallback` is the shipped default of the
// key being read, 0.0 for LocalSmoothing and 0.15 for RemoteSmoothing, so a
// malformed RemoteSmoothing lands on the remote default instead of silently
// handing a phone-over-WiFi user the local "no smoothing at all".

// misconfiguring - but the sign is, because a negative one does not merely widen or
// narrow the range, it inverts the clamp.
//
// PositionProcessor clamps z as Clamp(z, -limit_z, +limit_z_back), and Clamp is
// `v < min ? min : (v > max ? max : v)`. With LimitZ = -0.4 the bounds become
// [0.4, 0.1] - min above max - and every input returns one of those two constants. The
// camera parks at a fixed offset that no longer answers the tracker at all, which reads
// in game as positional tracking having died rather than as a bad value in the INI.
